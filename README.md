# nrfutilDfuAppGen
Application Generator from Hex to Zip for Nordic DFU. It's based on Nordic nrfutil cli tool and simply packed with a GUI.


`Need to put your own private key to the same directory to nrfutilDfuAppGen.exe and rename it to "private.key".`

The software is released with nrfutil v6.0.1. You may like to replace it with the latest version and you can download from [HERE](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil/releases).

Let me know if you need help or I made any mistake. I appreciate.
